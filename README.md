Sample project showing how to implement **Pull to Refresh on Android with Compose Material 3**.

It shows a list of random dog facts fetched from https://kinduff.github.io/dog-api/, allowing users to re-fetch them by pulling down from the top of the screen.

Tech stack:

* Compose (Material 3)
* MVVM
* Koin (dependency injection)
* Ktor (network)
* Kotlin Coroutines and Flows
